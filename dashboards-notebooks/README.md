# OpenSearch Dashboards Notebooks

Dashboards offer a solution for a few selected use cases, and are great tools if you’re focused on monitoring a known set of metrics over time. Notebooks enables contextual use of data with detailed explanations by allowing a user to combine saved visualizations, text, graphs and decorate data in elastic with other reference data sources.

## Documentation

Please see our technical [documentation](https://docs-beta.opensearch.org/dashboards/notebooks/) to learn more about its features.

## Setup

1. Download OpenSearch for the version that matches the [OpenSearch Dashboards version specified in package.json](./package.json#L7).

1. Change your node version to the version specified in `.node-version` inside the OpenSearch Dashboards root directory.
1. Create a `plugins` directory inside the OpenSearch Dashboards source code directory, if `plugins` directory doesn't exist.

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:opensearch-project/dashboards-notebooks.git plugins --no-checkout
